Homework 2
===========

For this homework, I had to create 2 apps:


Guess my number
---------------

This app sets a random number that the user has to guess. The possibilities are integers
from 1 to 100. The app guides the user by suggesting that the inserted number is either 
too low or too high.


Number Shapes
-------------

This app tells the user if the inserted number is either square, triangular or both.
A triangular number is a number that can be divided 3 times by the same
integer, and the result will also be an integer.
