Homework 3
==========

For this homework, I had to create 2 apps:

Phrases
-------

This app gives the user the possibility to see a fixed number of phrases translated
from Romanian to English. When pressing any card that contains a phrase, it will
automatically start a voice recording of that phrase in the correspondent language. 
The voice recordings are from Google Translate.

Tic Tac Toe
-----------

This app is a classic tic-tac-toe game. There should be two users playing, taking rounds.
The started is always Red, followed by Green. The rules are as following:

    -   a player can color a single square per round
    -   the square that will be colored has to be empty
    -   a player wins if their color is on 3 consecutive squares in a vertical, 
    horizontal or diagonal line
    
When a player wins, a pop-up will appear that announces the winner, and their score 
will be updated. If there is a draw, no score will be updated.

If a player color a square by mistake, there is an option to replay that round by pressing
the "Try Again" button. This will not affect the current scores. If the two players want
 to replay the whole game, there is a "Reset Game" button, that clears both scores.
