Homework 1 - Currency Converter
===============================

From this app you can convert a certain amount of euros into lei. The amount of 
lei per 1 euro is fixed to 4.87, as was the value from the moment I wrote the app.

As being the first homework, the purpose of it is to get familiar with widgets 
and setState, so this is a simple example to begin with.

The most challenging part of this app was data validation, because the accepted 
input cannot be empty or any string, and can also accept decimals.
